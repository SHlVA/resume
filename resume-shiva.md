## Overview

Software developer with 13+ years of experience in design and development of applications and infrastructure on control/embedded/general purpose systems. In the past, network/data-center management has been my staple. For the last five years, I have been working on management infrastructure and App-SDK for the IP operating system for Ericsson networking devices, related to provided FCAPS support for various domains/applications/platforms that leverage this OS. 

In addition to my day job, I sometimes dabble in solving problems for fun. Some of them can be found at [github.com/shiva][3].

## Experience

### Aug 2007 to now  - Ericsson Inc. (acquired Redback) / Redback Networks, Vancouver, Canada

 * Re-architecture of a code-base of ~22 million lines to create components, defining APIs, and SDKs for improving modularity, and developer productivity. (on-going)
 * Working on a generic linux kernel based network OS. The legacy system uses a custom run-to-completion version of the linux kernel. (on-going)
 * Re-design of build infrastructure. Moved from custom written makefiles to cmake based tool-chain (ongoing)
 * Consultation for various projects for (on-going)
     + migrating to newly created management infrastructure
	 + leverage tools, frameworks and utilities created to improve quality and developer productivity
	 + Define, evangelize and enforce design guidelines 
	     + for customer-visible NBI models
		 + for internal APIs between components
     + training sessions and mentoring	 
 * Wrote a custom DSL to provide ORM between two proprietary data-definitions languages.
 * Built a parser-generator for proprietary UML-based language. This was used successfully to generate
     + Unit/Functional test code (based on a interface-agnostic test framework written in python + SWIG)
     + ORM files as a starting point for mapping model-based input, to platform-specific API calls to store/retrieve from an in-memory DB.
     + Sample configuration for NMS developer/end-customers to understand a specific set of models. 
 * Ported software for License-management from generic linux to proprietary platform.
 * Built core-infrastructure for model-based NBI support - CLI, NETCONF, SNMP. 
 * Created SDK for applications to plug into the aforementioned infrastructure
     + Configuration and Fault Management APIs
     + License Management, Authorization 
 * Network management: device integration, custom SOAP/XML northbound interface, GUI
 * Study and work for replacing CORBA based legacy fault management implementation with pub-sub
 * Network Management support for several networking features - Dot1q, Bridging, L2/L3 VPN, etc

### Dec 2006 to Jul 2007  - Novell, Bangalore, India	

 * Developed component for boot-time remote view of end-hosts
 * Case-study for technology support for hardware by multiple vendors.

### Nov 2002 to Dec 2006  - HCL Technologies (Cisco Partner), Chennai, India	

 * Near real-time system for monitoring traps from access layer devices to track end-hosts in a network.
 * DHTML based Topology display framework.
 * Framework for multi-path stage-based code execution.
 * Component for RMI and eventing over HTTP using SOAP and HTTP persistent connection.
 * Client utility to aggregate end-host information.
 * In-memory logging framework with no performance impact.
 * Case-study on replacing CORBA dependent components with SOAP services.

### May 2001 to Oct 2002 - Intec Solutions, Chennai, India

 * Worked on several products, providing configuration and management of devices used for instrumentation and control.
 * Created components that implement MODBUS and CANBUS protocols to interact with micro-controllers using ATL COM.
 * Provided technical support during client interactions.
 * Implemented standard development processes, including formal documentation at various stages of product development, version control, static analysis etc
