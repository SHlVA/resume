## Overview

Software developer with 14+ years of experience in design and development of applications and infrastructure on control/embedded/general-purpose systems. In the past, network management has been my staple. For the last six years, I have been working on developer-platforms and infrastructure for data management for the IP operating system (IPOS) for Ericsson networking devices.

In addition to my day job, I sometimes dabble in solving problems for fun. Some of them can be found at [github.com/shiva][3].

## Experience

### Aug 2007 to now  - Ericsson Inc. (acquired Redback) / Redback Networks, Vancouver, Canada

#### Recently:

 * Define vision for next-gen architecture for application development on IPOS. (on-going)
 * Design and develop Managed Data infrastructure (MDI). It is a design method, with multiple DSLs to achieve declarative programming of applications. (on-going)
 * Built 3 key teams that work in concert to transform application development on IPOS-based devices and platforms, by delivering MDI.
 * Created a high-density, low-latency, transactional data-store with record-level locking.
 * Created a meta-data aware, non-transactional cache with eventual data-consistency.
 * Created a portable plugin framework for C applications.
 * Designed and engineered an API for data-access using MDI and its components, to build northbound-interfaces like CLI, or NETCONF-agents or RESTful services.
 * Implemented python and javascript apps that use MDI interfaces to demonstrate its abilities (using SWIG and FFI).
 * Consultation for various projects to
     + Provide guidance and mentoring for senior engineers in OAM domain.
     + Design configuration and run-state data for several feature daemons on IPOS like OSPF, Timing and Sync, Hardware Mgmt, License Mgmt, Bridging, etc.
     + Champion best practices, and move to agile practices
     + Defining and evangelizing good design practices
     + Training sessions and mentoring of several individuals.

#### In the past:

 * Transitioned a large set of components from legacy build system that reduced development, build and test cycle to seconds from hours.
 * Re-designed build infrastructure for IPOS platform and components. Moved from custom written makefiles to cmake based tool-chain
 * Wrote a custom DSL to provide ORM between two proprietary data-definitions languages.
 * Built a parser-generator for proprietary UML-based language. This was used successfully to generate
     + Unit/Functional test code (based on a interface-agnostic test framework written in python + SWIG)
     + ORM files for mapping model-based input, to platform-specific API calls.
 * Ported software for License-management from generic linux to proprietary platform.
 * Built infrastructure for model-based NBI support - CLI, NETCONF, SNMP.
 * Created SDK for applications to plug into infrastructure.
 * Network management: device integration, custom SOAP/XML northbound interface, GUI
 * Study and work for replacing CORBA based legacy fault management implementation with pub-sub
 * Network Management support for several networking features - Dot1q, Bridging, L2/L3 VPN, etc

### Dec 2006 to Jul 2007  - Novell, Bangalore, India

 * Developed component for boot-time remote view of end-hosts
 * Case-study for technology support for hardware by multiple vendors.

### Nov 2002 to Dec 2006  - HCL Technologies (Cisco Partner), Chennai, India

 * Near real-time system for monitoring traps from access layer devices to track end-hosts in a network.
 * DHTML based Topology display framework.
 * Framework for multi-path stage-based code execution.
 * Component for RMI and eventing over HTTP using SOAP and HTTP persistent connection.
 * Client utility to aggregate end-host information.
 * In-memory logging framework with no performance impact.
 * Case-study on replacing CORBA dependent components with SOAP services.

### May 2001 to Oct 2002 - Intec Solutions, Chennai, India

 * Worked on several products, providing configuration and management of devices used for instrumentation and control.
 * Created components that implement MODBUS and CANBUS protocols to interact with micro-controllers using ATL COM.
 * Provided technical support during client interactions.
 * Implemented standard development processes, including formal documentation at various stages of product development, version control, static analysis etc  

## Skills
