## Overview

Product owner and architect with 15+ years of experience in design and development of applications on networking devices. Adept in helping build and work with high-performing engineering teams. For the last six years, I have been delivering transformational software infrastructure for the IP operating system (IPOS) for Ericsson networking devices.

In addition to my day job, I sometimes dabble in solving programming problems for fun. Some of them can be found at [github.com/shiva][3].

## Experience

### Aug 2007 to present - Ericsson Inc., Vancouver, Canada
*<small>HCL Axon Technologies acquired Ericsson Vancouver effective Jan 2016.</small>*

   * **Current designation**: senior technical architect
   * **Current role**: product owner for IPOS infrastructure
   * **Previous roles**: senior software engineer, software designer and technical lead

#### Recent achievements
   * Defined vision, strategy and roadmap for next-gen declarative application development on IPOS product line.
   * Secured executive buy-in and investment in multi-year infrastructure project.
   * Built and mentored four agile product development teams across multiple sites and time-zones.
   * Designed and developed Managed Data Infrastructure (MDI). MDI is a set of components for managing schema-based data using a high performance database in carrier-class router operating system.
   * Migrated six router applications within three months resulting in
     - reduced code base by 70 to 80 per cent;
     - increased developer productivity by two to three times; and,
     - improved time to market from multiple weeks to a few days.
   * Prioritized and shaped requirements from multiple stakeholders, including: developers, system managers and product sponsors within Ericsson.
   * Evangelized software design practices within the IPOS organization.

#### In the past
   * Created a meta-data aware, non-transactional cache with eventual data consistency.
   * Created a high-density, low-latency, transactional datastore with record-level locking.
   * Shortened development cycle from hours to seconds by redesigning build infrastructure for IPOS platform and components.
   * Wrote a custom DSL to provide Object Relationship Mapping (ORM) between two proprietary data-definitions languages.
   * Designed common models for IPOS and evangelized Ericsson Common Information Model (ECIM) and its adoption across IPOS features. This included setting standards, establishing a technical council of developers proficient in modeling, training and mentoring them to work with IPOS feature teams.
   * Implemented python and javascript apps to demonstrate MDI's abilities as a ecosystem for rapid app development (using SWIG and FFI).
   * Created a portable framework for developing C applications on embedded devices.
   * Replaced CORBA-based legacy fault management implementation with pub-sub.
   * Provided support for several networking features in Netop product, including: Dot1q, Bridging, L2/L3 VPN, etc.

### Dec 2006 to Jul 2007 - Novell, Bangalore, India

   * Developed cross-platform component for boot-time remote view of end-hosts.
   * Drove case study for technology support for hardware by multiple vendors.

### Nov 2002 to Dec 2006 - HCL Technologies (Cisco Partner), Chennai, India

   * Designed and developed a cutting-edge Topology display framework in javascript.
   * Designed and built a highly scalable system for monitoring traps from access-layer devices to track end-hosts in a network.
   * Created a popular client utility to aggregate end-host information.

### May 2001 to Oct 2002 - Intec Solutions, Chennai, India

   * Created management application for several products used for industrial automation.
   * Created components to interact with micro-controllers using MODBUS and CANBUS in ATL COM.
   * Implemented standard development processes, including: documentation, version control, static analysis, code-reviews, etc.  

## Skills
