## Overview

Software engineer with 14+ years of experience in design and development of applications and infrastructure on control, embedded and general-purpose systems. Previously, network management was my staple. For the last six years, I have focussed on improving productivity and quality of IP operating system (IPOS) applications for Ericsson networking devices.

In addition to my day job, I sometimes dabble in solving programming problems for fun. Some of them can be found at [github.com/shiva][3].

## Experience

### Aug 2007 to now - Ericsson Inc. (acquired Redback Networks), Vancouver, Canada

#### Recent achievements
 * Define vision, strategy and architecture for application development on IPOS. (on-going)
 * Design and develop Managed Data Infrastructure (MDI), a design method with multiple DSLs to achieve declarative programming of applications. (on-going)
 * Built three key teams that will transform application development on IPOS-based devices and platforms by delivering MDI.
 * Created a high-density, low-latency, transactional datastore with record-level locking.
 * Created a meta-data aware, non-transactional cache with eventual data consistency.
 * Created a portable plugin framework for C applications.
 * Designed and engineered an API for data access using MDI and its components, to build northbound interfaces like CLI, NETCONF-agents, and RESTful services.
 * Implemented python and javascript apps to demonstrate MDI's abilities as a ecosystem for rapid app development (using SWIG and FFI).
 * Active consultation for various projects to:
     + Design configuration and run-state data for several feature daemons on IPOS like OSPF, Timing and Sync, Hardware Management, License Management, Bridging, etc.
     + Champion adoption of tools and processes by training and mentoring teams and individuals.
     + Define and evangelize software design practices within the IPOS organisation.

#### In the past
 * Redesigned build-infrastructure for IPOS platform and components. Moved from custom written makefiles to cmake-based toolchain.
 * Shortened development cycle from hours to seconds by transitioning components to new build system.
 * Wrote a custom DSL to provide Object Relationship Mapping (ORM) between two proprietary data-definitions languages.
 * Built a parser-generator for proprietary UML-based language. This was used successfully to generate:
     + Unit/Functional test code (based on a interface-agnostic test framework written in python + SWIG).
     + ORM files for mapping model-based input to platform-specific API calls.
 * Supported license management in IPOS.
 * Built infrastructure for model-based NBI support, including: CLI, NETCONF, SNMP, etc.
 * Created SDK for applications to plug into infrastructure.
 * Provided device integration, custom SOAP/XML northbound interface and GUI for the Netop product.
 * Replaced CORBA-based legacy fault management implementation with pub-sub.
 * Provided support for several networking features in Netop product, including: Dot1q, Bridging, L2/L3 VPN, etc.

### Dec 2006 to Jul 2007 - Novell, Bangalore, India

 * Developed component for boot-time remote view of end-hosts.
 * Drove case study for technology support for hardware by multiple vendors.

### Nov 2002 to Dec 2006 - HCL Technologies (Cisco Partner), Chennai, India

 * Designed and built high-scale system for monitoring traps from access layer devices to track end-hosts in a network.
 * Designed and developed DHTML and javascript based Topology display framework.
 * Architected framework for multi-path stage-based code execution.
 * Created a component for RMI and eventing over HTTP using SOAP and persistent connections.
 * Created a popular client utility to aggregate end-host information.
 * Designed and implemented an in-memory logging framework with no performance impact.
 * Led case-study on replacing CORBA dependent components with SOAP services.

### May 2001 to Oct 2002 - Intec Solutions, Chennai, India

 * Led configuration and management of devices used for instrumentation and control on several products.
 * Created components that implement MODBUS and CANBUS protocols to interact with micro-controllers using ATL COM.
 * Implemented standard development processes, including: formal documentation at various stages of product development, version control, static analysis, etc.
