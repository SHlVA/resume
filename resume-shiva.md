## Overview

Product owner and architect with 17+ years of experience in design and development of enterprise and telecommunications applications. Adept in building and working with high-performing engineering teams. 

In addition to my day job, I sometimes dabble in solving programming problems for fun. Some of them can be found at [github.com/shiva][3].

## Experience

### May 2017 to present - GE Digital, Burnaby, Canada 

   * Owning and driving product requirements for security and data management for two key GE Digital products: Predix Studio and Predix AppEngine.
     - Target markets include GE business verticals of power, mining, aviation and healthcare.
     - Total addressable revenue potential: 100M+
   * Championing adoption of cloudfoundry security model resulting in integration with other GE products targeting 100M+ potential revenue.
   * Initiated and drove the adoption of GE security policies reducing number of security issues from 1000+ to under 10.
   * Instituted data-driven approach to product roadmap definition and planning
   * Channeled all engineering teams' focus to improve product quality. Reduced from 3000+ bugs to less than 200.
   * Reduced operational cost by streamlining product infrastructure, testing practices and instituting CI/CD. Reduced bug incidence during regression by ~300% YoY. (tracking this over the last 3 quarters)

### Jan 2016 to May 2017 - HCL Axon Technologies (for Ericsson Inc.), Burnaby, Canada
### Aug 2007 to Dec 2015 - Ericsson Inc., Burnaby, Canada

#### As a product owner 
   * Defined vision, strategy and roadmap for next-gen declarative application development on IPOS product line.
     - Secured executive buy-in and investment in multi-year infrastructure projects.
     - Prioritized and shaped requirements from multiple stakeholders, including: developers, system managers and product sponsors within Ericsson.
     - Built and mentored four agile product development teams across multiple sites and time-zones.
   * Migrated six router applications within three months resulting in
     - Reduced code base by 70 to 80 per cent;
     - Increased developer productivity by two to three times; and,
     - Improved time to market from months to days.

#### As an engineer/architect

   * Designed and developed Managed Data Infrastructure (MDI). MDI is a set of components for managing schema-based data using a high performance database in carrier-class router operating system.
   * Created a meta-data aware, non-transactional cache with eventual data consistency.
   * Created a high-density, low-latency, transactional datastore with record-level locking.
   * Shortened development cycle from hours to seconds by redesigning build infrastructure for IPOS platform and components.
   * Wrote a custom DSL to provide Object Relationship Mapping (ORM) between two proprietary data-definitions languages.
   * Designed common models for IPOS and evangelized Ericsson Common Information Model (ECIM) and its adoption across IPOS features. This included setting standards, establishing a technical council of developers proficient in modeling, training and mentoring them to work with IPOS feature teams.
   * Implemented python and javascript apps to demonstrate MDI's abilities as a ecosystem for rapid app development (using SWIG and FFI).
   * Replaced CORBA-based legacy fault management implementation with pub-sub.
   * Provided support for several networking features in Netop product, including: Dot1q, Bridging, L2/L3 VPN, etc.

### Dec 2006 to Jul 2007 - Novell, Bangalore, India

   * Developed cross-platform component for boot-time remote view of end-hosts.
   * Drove case study for technology support for hardware by multiple vendors.

### Nov 2002 to Dec 2006 - HCL Technologies (Cisco Partner), Chennai, India

   * Designed and developed a cutting-edge topology display framework in javascript.
   * Designed and built a highly scalable system for monitoring traps from access-layer devices to track end-hosts in a network.
