<h4 id="senior-security-operations-engineer---november-2016-to-present">Senior Security Operations Engineer - November 2016 to Present</h4>
<p>I was brought on to the new Oracle Cloud to be a technical lead in the Security Operations group. I was responsible for the technical direction of the team and in general for defining Security Operations for Oracle Cloud. This included work such as implementing our first vulnerability scanning system and scaling out a yubikey-based authentication solution for internal users.</p>
<p>Much of my development work revolved around our software patching system. I took an initial system based on Fabric and scaled it up to patch several hundred servers on a monthly basis (with a comprehensive health check mechanism to avoid outages). This included both Python and Bash scripting. I also did reverse engineering work on our yubikey programming system to both document and improve it (that was in Ruby).</p>
<p>I also managed metrics and alerting for the team, in our in-house system. It used a Grafana front end and I was responsible for designing and implementing dashboards.</p>
<p>I also ran a biweekly team operational excellence meeting, focused on ensuring that we took proper steps to correct outages and improved our general operational ability.</p>

<h4 id="senior-production-engineer---july-2015-to-november-2016">Senior Production Engineer - July 2015 to November 2016</h4>
<p>I was part of the Production Engineering team. My responsibilities included designing deployment and automation services.</p>
<p>I worked on a lot of deployment automation using NixOS, a declarative Linux OS which allows you to precisely specify the deployment state of a service. For example, I wrote a a completely automated deployment process using NixOS to install Artifactory to Amazon EC2.</p>
<p>I also managed other developer services like Jenkins and Gerrit, and assist with various other duties involving our build pipeline.</p>

<p>I was part of the DevOps team and I wore many hats. I handled everything from writing scripts to automate Mysql server failovers to overseeing our monitoring setup.</p>
<p>One thing I loved about this job is how many new technologies I was able to learn. This was the first time I ever wrote any ruby scripts for system administration and I enjoyed it thoroughly.</p>

I cover everything from planning our strategic projects to writing perl scripts to analyze install logs. I also coordinate the activities of our Sunnyvale and Bangalore Release Management teams.</p>
