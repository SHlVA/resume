## Overview

I'm a senior operations engineer and team leader [with a focus on DevOps][]. 
I love working with Linux and writing scripts to [manage large-scale deployment issues][].

## Experience

### [Oracle][], San Francisco, CA

#### Senior Security Operations Engineer - November 2016 to Present

I was brought on to the new Oracle Cloud to be a technical lead in the Security Operations group.  I was responsible for the technical direction of the team and in general for defining Security Operations for Oracle Cloud.  This included work such as implementing our first vulnerability scanning system and scaling out a yubikey-based authentication solution for internal users.

Much of my development work revolved around our software patching system.  I took an initial system based on Fabric and scaled it up to patch several hundred servers on a monthly basis (with a comprehensive health check mechanism to avoid outages).  This included both Python and Bash scripting.  I also did reverse engineering work on our yubikey programming system to both document and improve it (that was in Ruby).

I also managed metrics and alerting for the team, in our in-house system.  It used a Grafana front end and I was responsible for designing and implementing dashboards.

I also ran a biweekly team operational excellence meeting, focused on ensuring that we took proper steps to correct outages and improved our general operational ability.

### [Lookout][], San Francisco, CA

#### Senior Production Engineer - July 2015 to November 2016

I was part of the Production Engineering team. My responsibilities included designing deployment and automation services.

I worked on a lot of deployment automation using NixOS, a declarative Linux OS which allows you to precisely specify the deployment state of a service. For example, I wrote a a completely automated deployment process using NixOS to install Artifactory to Amazon EC2.

I also managed other developer services like Jenkins and Gerrit, and assisted with various other duties involving our build pipeline.

### [Goodreads][], San Francisco, CA

#### Senior Systems Engineer - April 2014 to July 2015

I was part of the DevOps team and I wore many hats. I handled everything from writing scripts to automate Mysql server failovers to overseeing our monitoring setup.

One thing I loved about this job is how many new technologies I was able to learn. This was the first time I ever wrote any ruby scripts for system administration and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

### [Yahoo][], Sunnyvale CA

#### Manager, Release Management - September 2011 to April 2014

I managed a team of three people who are responsible for software releases
across all of Yahoo Communications (including Mail and Messenger). My team set
standards for software releases, planned the releases, and pushed the software
to production servers. We regularly pushed changes to 10,000 servers a week. I
covered everything from planning our strategic projects to writing perl scripts
to analyze install logs.  I also coordinated the activities of our Sunnyvale
and Bangalore Release Management teams.

*Highlight*: Wrote a series of perl scripts to analyze mail farm
software release quality. Trained Release and QA teams to use these
scripts to automate release testing, resulting in a 75% reduction in QA
support requests to my group.

#### Tech Lead, Release Management - July 2008 to September 2011

Responsible for assembling, verifying, and scheduling software releases
for approximately 10,000 servers. Develop release and monitoring scripts
in Bash and Perl. Perform all types of Linux and FreeBSD system
administration from remote installs to performance tuning. Act as
liaison between Mail operations and development. Debug and fix
large-scale user mail problems.

*Highlight*: Technical lead on year-long project to convert all 7000
mail front end systems
[to a new rules-based configuration management system][]. This
involved  extensive scripting, tracking down dependencies, and
validating system installs of several thousand software packages.

### [Schrodinger][], New York, NY

#### Senior System Administrator - August 2005 to July 2008

Support 30 users and 100 mixed Linux, Unix, and Windows servers and
workstations. Install, configure, and administer several cluster systems
running ROCKS, PBS Pro, and SGE. Install and administer United Devices
GridMP grid computing system.

*Highlight*: Planned and implemented office and network move between
floors of midtown Manhattan office tower. This included designing and
configuring a server room for several hundred systems (including two
clusters) with full AC and UPS support.

Schrodinger is a leader in developing chemical simulation software for
use in pharmaceutical and biotechnology research.
